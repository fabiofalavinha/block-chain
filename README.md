# block-chain

### Blockchain is the backbone Technology of Digital CryptoCurrency BitCoin.

- A Blockchain is a list of records called blocks that are linked together using linked lists and use the cryptographic technique.

- Each block contains its own digital fingerprint called Hash, the hash of the previous block, a timestamp and the data of the transaction made, making it more secure towards any kind of data breach.

- Therefore, if the data of one block is changed then its hash will also change. If the hash is changed, then its hash will be different from the next block that contains the hash of the previous block affecting all the hashes of the blocks after it. Changing of the hashes and then comparing it with other blocks allows us to check the blockchain.
